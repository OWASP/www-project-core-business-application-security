# Areas of Contribution
We have different areas and projects that we love for you to help us with. You don't need to be a security expert to help us out. If you enjoy developing new tools, designing pages, creating documentation, or even translating, we want you!

We have created and adopted different projects that cover people, processes, and technologies when securing SAP applications. Contribution to one or all of these projects is welcome.
