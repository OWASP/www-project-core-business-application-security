## About This Repository

This repository is maintained by the [OWASP Core Business Application Security (CBAS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-core-business-application-security/) project and serves as a public archive of research efforts focused on **SAP Security**.

Here we collect:

- **Research Papers & Whitepapers**
Novel attack vectors, analysis of SAP technologies, and deep-dives into misconfigurations or overlooked weaknesses.

- **Proof-of-Concept Exploits (PoCs)**
Demonstrative code snippets and reproducible environments for responsible testing and education.

- **Detection & Hardening Tools**
Scripts and techniques to aid defenders in identifying vulnerable components, misconfigurations, and implementing mitigations.

All contributions are intended to **educate, empower, and protect** the global SAP ecosystem in line with OWASPâ€™s mission.
