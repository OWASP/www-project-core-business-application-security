## SAP Security Verification Standard (SSVS)
The CBAS - SAP Security Verification Standard (SSVS) project allows organizations to determine their SAP security posture based on controls used to define a standard security baseline that organizations can maintain and adopt. This enables organizations to plan and enhance their security mechanisms when protecting SAP resources.

The NO MONKEY Security Matrix combines elements of the security operational functions, defined by NIST, and IPAC model, created by NO MONKEY and explained below, into a functional graph.
