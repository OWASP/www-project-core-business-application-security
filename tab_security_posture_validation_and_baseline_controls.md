## SAP Security Verification Standard (SSVS)
The CBAS - SAP Security Verification Standard (SSVS) project allows organizations to determine their SAP security posture based on controls used to define a standard security baseline that organizations can maintain and adopt. This enables organizations to plan and enhance their security mechanisms when protecting SAP resources.
