## pysap - Python library for crafting SAP's network protocols packets
[![Build and test pysap](https://github.com/OWASP/pysap/workflows/Build%20and%20test%20pysap/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OWASP/pysap/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+and+test+pysap%22)
[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pysap.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysap/)

Version 0.1.20.dev0 (XXX 2022)

### Overview
[SAP Netweaver](https://www.sap.com/platform/netweaver/index.epx) and [SAP HANA](https://www.sap.com/products/hana.html) are technology platforms for building and integrating SAP business applications. Communication between components uses different network protocols and some services and tools make use of custom file formats as well. While some of them are standard and well-known protocols, others are proprietaries and public information is generally not available.

pysap is an open source Python 2 library that provides modules for crafting and sending packets
using SAP's NI, Diag, Enqueue, Router, MS, SNC, IGS, RFC and HDB protocols. In addition, support for creating and parsing different proprietary file formats is included. The modules are built on top of [Scapy](https://scapy.net/) and are based on information acquired at researching the different protocols, file formats and services.

### Features

* Dissection and crafting of the following network protocols:

    * SAP Network Interface (NI)
    * SAP Diag
    * SAP Enqueue
    * SAP Router
    * SAP Message Server (MS)
    * SAP Secure Network Connection (SNC)
    * SAP Internet Graphic Server (IGS)
    * SAP Remote Function Call (RFC)
    * SAP HANA SQL Command Network (HDB)

* Client interfaces for handling the following file formats:

    * SAP [SAR archive files](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.sar)
    * SAP Personal Security Environment (PSE) files
    * SAP SSO Credential (Credv2) files
    * SAP Secure Storage in File System (SSFS) files

* Library implementing SAP's LZH and LZC compression algorithms.

* Automatic compression/decompression of payloads with SAP's algorithms.

* Client, proxy and server classes implemented for some of the protocols.

* Example scripts to illustrate the use of the different modules and protocols.

## SAPKiln
![SAPiln Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/1.0-0000?label=Version)

The world :earth_americas: of SAP is very vast and unique. SAP has multiple products to tackle various problems as well as multiple technology platforms such as NetWeaver etc. SAPKiln is an open-source GUI tool :computer: designed to empower security researchers in conducting efficient auditing and penetration testing of SAP systems through SAP Logon/GUI (desktop application). It caters to both experienced SAP professionals and those unfamiliar with the SAP environment, as it streamlines the process of performing security checks with a user-friendly interface:sparkles:.

Powered :battery: by saplogon.exe and SAP scripting in its backend, SAPKiln executes automated checks in the SAP system. The current version (v1.0) boasts a comprehensive array of over 70+ checks :exclamation: divided into 10 modules. Beyond its built-in checks, SAPKiln provides flexibility with dynamic checks, accommodating custom user inputs. By automating security assessments, SAPKiln effectively bridges the knowledge gap for security researchers :cop: compared to SAP domain experts:eyeglasses:.
