**"The more the survey takers are, the better the results and analysis become to understand the gap areas within your organization"**

The below video illustrates how you can get started with the Security Aptitude Assessment and Analysis.

[![Getting Started](assets/images/Example_4.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZglYrmugTX0)

To get started, download a copy of the _"Security_Aptitude_Analysis"_, _"SAA_Assessment"_ and _"Survey"_ documents from the [Analysis folder](https://github.com/NO-MONKEY/CBAS/tree/master/Analysis) or the [Downloads tab](https://owasp.org/www-project-core-business-application-security/#div-downloads)

Assessment requirements:
- Each assessment must uniquely be identified by an ID number (i.e. 1,2,3...)

- The _"Data"_ sheet inside the assessment should be exported
to the generic file _"Survey.xlsx"_.

- Once you have copied or exported the data to the _"Survey.xlsx"_ file, edit the data source path in the _"Security_Aptitude_Analysis"_ file to change it to your preferred location

- Once you open the _"Security_Aptitude_Analysis"_ the file will prompt to update the data source _(this will depend on the excel version you are running)_

- Once you change the data source, any new data that you export or copy to the _"Survey"_ file make sure you refresh the _"Security_Aptitude_Analysis"_ file to get the recent changes. **Navigate to Data > Refresh All**
