# SAP Attack Surface Discovery

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure you have the appropriate permissions to actively scan and test applications. Without doing so, you might face legal implications

The project aims to help organizations and security professionals to identify and discover open SAP services through the use of different network scanning techniques. This allows individuals to further test these services for any potential threat that might affect SAP applications in their organizations.  

## OWASP CBAS project

Three areas within the __NO MONKEY Security Matrix__ can benefit from the project:
1. Identify – NIST Security Functions
2. Detect - NIST Security Functions
3. Integration – IPAC Model

### Identify | Integration

When applied to a single organization, the results from the project can aid organizations to further concentrate their efforts in the IDENTIFY and INTEGRATION quadrant of the NO MONKEY Security Matrix.

### Detect | Integration

Another potential area of benefit will be under the DETECT and INTEGRATION quadrant, this will allow organizations to automate their monitoring capabilities when it comes to publishing SAP application to the internet. If publishing these applications is not a requirement and have been done due to misconfiguration then the organization would be able to properly detect it.
