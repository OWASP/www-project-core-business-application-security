### SAP Internet Research Project

The SAP Internet Research project aims to help organization and security professionals to identify and discover open SAP services facing the internet. This allows individuals to further test these services for any potential threat that might affect SAP applications in their organizations. (More on how to conduct the tests in your organizations can be found [here](https://github.com/NO-MONKEY/CBAS/blob/master/SAP_Internet_Research.md))
